* Notes for Introduction to Algorithms Book
- Going to use Rust and Clojure
- Avoid Using TCO in RUST as it doesn not support it. Using loops is more performant for now.
- Try to write pure functions as much as possible.
- Test the algoriths in HackerEarth or something instead of hand writing the tests.
